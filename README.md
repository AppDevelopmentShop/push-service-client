pushService.register(userToken, firebaseToken)
```  
You can unregister firebase token from some user.  
```  
pushService.unregister(userToken, firebaseToken)
```  
You can send message to some user, using ``` userToken ``` that was use while registering.
``` 
pushService.send(userToken, {
    title: 'push title',
    body: 'push text',
    payload: {
        field: "all addditional info"
    }
})
``` 
``` userToken ``` - some user identificator, string  
``` firebaseToken ``` - firebase token that was send by user and generated by firebase  
  
Or you can create multiple clients for each service:  

```
const client1 = pushService.createClient({ host: 'localhost', port: 8081 })
```  
```
const client2 = pushService.createClient({ host: 'localhost', port: 8082 })
```
